# Shashiपथ

Shashiपथ is a project initiated during the ISRO Hackathon, now progressing into a comprehensive research paper. Our objective is to develop an advanced algorithm to find the safest navigation route for a lunar rover on the moon's surface.

## Key Features

- **Image Upload**: Allows uploading of lunar surface images.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Identifies and marks craters and boulders.
- **Path Optimization**: Calculates the safest and most efficient route for the rover, avoiding detected obstacles.
- **Scientific Exploration**: Focuses on optimizing stops at mineral interest points within a 100-meter radius.

## Status

The project is currently in the implementation phase.

## Goals

- Enhance the safety and efficiency of lunar rovers.
- Contribute to the advancement of autonomous navigation systems in space exploration.
- Provide a robust tool for future lunar missions.

## Future Work

- Integrating real-time data processing.
- Improving the accuracy of obstacle detection.
- Extending the algorithm to adapt to various lunar terrains.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. Please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to help us improve Shashiपथ.
